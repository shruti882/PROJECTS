IOT BASED SMART ICU SYSTEM FOR INTENSIVE CARE

1.ABSTRACT

Intensive Care Unit or ICU is where the patients who are critically ill and admitted for treatment. For such critical conditions the Doctors need to have an all-time update patients health related parameters like their blood pressure, heart pulse ,temperature Asthma,Environment  and  saline is full or not.Doing manually is too tedious a task and also for multiple patients it becomes close to impossible. For this type of situations this IoT based system can bring about an automation that can keep the doctors updated all time over the network.IoT Based ICU Monitoring System is an Arduino based system which collects patients information with the help of few sensors. In the present world,Health monitoring systems are one of the most notable applications of IoT. Most of ICU devices are equipped with various sensors to measure health parameters, but to monitor it all the time is still challenging job. This health care system reduces possibility of human errors, delay in communication and helps doctor to spare more time in decision with accurate observations.This paper proposes a smart healthcare system in IoT environment that can monitor a patient’s basic health signs as well as the room condition where the patients are now in real-time. The purpose of this study is to suggest an IoT design for smart monitoring and emergency alert system for patients in ICU which will monitor a patient using sensors.In this system, three sensors are used to capture the data from hospital named Pulse Sensor, Temperature Sensor and Load Cell.Arduino Uno Controller which will gather information from the patient and send to the IoT server.The sensor value crossed threshold values.

2.INTRODUCTION

The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services.IoT in healthcare is the key player in providing better medical facilities to the patients and facilitates the doctors and hospitals as well.Now, IoT is one of the buildings blocks that is considered to be use for developing smart system for Healthcare services. “Objects” connected to the internet are highlighted to cross 20 billion in the upcoming smart Technology. Medical field technology place a big role when it comes to patient care.. In the old days doctors or nurses would just communicate with patient manually which causes mistakes.\\ There are lots of IoT devices now a days to monitor the patient over internet. Health experts are also taking advantage of these smart devices to keep an eye on their patients in the hospital.  The combination of IoT with arduino is the new way of introducing Internet of Things in Health care Monitoring system of patients in ICU.

3.OBJECTIVES

1)  Provide solution with least hardware requirement.
2)	To develop an application that is cost eﬃcient.
3)	To detect blood pressure and pulse rate of an Individual using wearable sensor.
4)	To transmit these information to the concerned Doctor.
5)	To ensure data readability of the sensors where anybody can easily identify the status of the health.
6)	To provide a fast responding alert mechanism and timely medical help for critically ill patients
